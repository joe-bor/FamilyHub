# Technical Debt & Deferred Improvements

**Last Updated:** January 1, 2026

This document tracks known technical debt, deferred improvements, and future enhancements identified during code reviews. Items are prioritized and linked to relevant sprints.

---

## High Priority (Address Soon)

_No high priority items at this time._

---

## Medium Priority (Future Sprint)

### 1. Orphaned Events Warning
**Source:** PR #10 Review (Sprint 5)
**Files:** `src/stores/family-store.ts`, `src/components/settings/family-settings-modal.tsx`
**Status:** Deferred to Backend Integration

**Problem:**
When a member is deleted:
1. Their events become orphaned (hidden by filter but still exist)
2. No warning shown to user
3. Backend sync could fail if it validates member IDs

**Suggested Fix:**
- Count assigned events before delete
- Show confirmation dialog: "This member has X events. Delete anyway?"
- Consider cascade delete or reassignment to "Unassigned" member

---

## Low Priority (Nice to Have)

### 1. Web Vitals Tracking
**Source:** Sprint 6 Performance Optimization
**Status:** Deferred - Quick Wins Only

**Description:**
Add client-side Core Web Vitals tracking (LCP, FID, CLS) for production monitoring.

**Suggested Implementation:**
- Install `web-vitals` library
- Report metrics to analytics or logging service
- Track performance trends over time

---

### 2. Lighthouse CI Integration
**Source:** Sprint 6 Performance Optimization
**Status:** Deferred - Quick Wins Only

**Description:**
Automated performance budgets and regression detection in CI.

**Suggested Implementation:**
- Add `@lhci/cli` to GitHub Actions workflow
- Configure performance budgets (e.g., LCP < 2.5s, bundle size limits)
- Fail PRs that exceed budgets
- Track historical performance data

---

### 3. Production Monitoring (RUM)
**Source:** Sprint 6 Performance Optimization
**Status:** Deferred - Quick Wins Only

**Description:**
Real User Monitoring to understand actual user experience.

**Suggested Implementation:**
- Integrate Sentry Performance or similar RUM solution
- Track page load times, API latency, errors by user segment
- Set up alerting for performance regressions

## Backend Compatibility Notes

These items should be addressed when integrating with the backend API:

1. **Member ID Format**: Frontend uses `crypto.randomUUID()`. Backend must accept UUID v4 format without reassigning IDs.

2. **Event-Member Relationship**: Need to decide on cascade delete vs. orphan handling when members are removed.

3. **API Contract**: Document expected endpoints for family management:
   - `POST /api/family` - Create family
   - `PUT /api/family` - Update family name
   - `POST /api/family/members` - Add member
   - `PUT /api/family/members/:id` - Update member
   - `DELETE /api/family/members/:id` - Remove member

4. **PWA API Response Caching**: Add service worker caching for API responses to enable offline functionality.
   - **Files:** `vite.config.ts` (workbox runtimeCaching)
   - **Suggested Config:**
     ```typescript
     {
       urlPattern: /\/api\/.*/,
       handler: "NetworkFirst",
       options: {
         cacheName: "api-cache",
         expiration: { maxAgeSeconds: 3600 },
         networkTimeoutSeconds: 3
       }
     }
     ```
   - This enables showing cached data when offline and falls back gracefully.
